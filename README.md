# Face_recognition_attendance_project
face recognition based attendance system using Computer Vision 
A desktop based application for facial recogntion based attendance system.
We have used TKINTER library for the desktop based UI.

We are Using Open CV for reading the image and for recognition of the face we use MTCNN and for training the model we use Keras using pretrained weights and models.
Later we will save the entry and exit time on the database along with the all the entry which is done at the time of taking the image and training.
It uses 50 images for training and prediction.
